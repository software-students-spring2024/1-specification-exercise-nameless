## Product Vision Statement

SnapCook aims to transform the culinary experience for young professionals by generating personalized recipes based on the ingredients available in their fridge, encouraging resourcefulness, saving time, and reducing food waste-- paving the way for a sustainable and efficient kitchen.

## User Requirements

-   As a user, I want the app to automatically know the expiration date of products without labeled dates so that I don't have to remember or guess.
-   As a user, I want the app to suggest recipes based on what I already have so that I can make use of leftovers instead of buying new items.
-   As a user, I want the app to require minimal manual input so that I can save time and effort.
-   As a user, I want the app to remind me how long fruits and vegetables have been in my fridge so that I can make better judgments about their freshness.
-   As a user, I want assurance that the app will not misjudge the edibility of food items so that I don't risk getting sick.
-   As a user, I want the app to suggest recipes based on what I have left in the fridge so that I can use up everything before a trip.
-   As a user, I want the app to partner with delivery services like Amazon Fresh so that I can easily purchase any additional ingredients I might need.
-   As a user, I want the app to provide a variety of recipes so that I can try new dishes and not get bored of eating the same thing.
-   As a user, I want to be able to provide health and nutrition information for the suggested recipes so that I can make informed decisions about what to eat.
-   As a user, I want the app to have a user-friendly interface so that it is easy and enjoyable to use.
