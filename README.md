## Stakeholders

Stakeholders are all either current students or early professions, in their early to mid 20s. 

#### Stakeholder 1: Kang

- "How does the app know the expiration date of products without labeled dates?"
- "Why do I need this app, if I can just check online about recipes on dishes that I like?
- "I would prefer to shop for some new items to complete the recipe than making edible stuff from leftovers."

#### Stakeholder 2: Paris

- "Do I need to manually input details? I don't want to spend time doing complicated inputs."
- "Fruits and vegetables are bought with different conditions, how can the app accurately tell when they would go bad?"
- "It is better to have it remind me how long they have been there, so that I can make better judgement."
- "If I have something in the fridge that turns bad faster than usual but the app says it is edible, then I get sick after consuming it, would the app take any responsibility?"

#### Stakeholder 3: Jonathan

- "I think I would be interested in trying the app, but not sure if I would come to rely on an app to make recipes with anything I have left over in the fridge."
- "I f I want to use everything, for instance, I want to use all the food in my fridge before I leave for a trip, then I would be more tempted to use this app to just clear everything out."
- "Perhaps an app that lets me know what common dishes I can make with the ingredients I already have, and maybe partner it up with delivery services like Amazon Fresh or DoorDash to get the ingredients I would be missing with an easy integration system."

#### Stakeholder 4: Jackie

- Finds it time-consuming to amnually input ingredients into meal planning apps. 
- Would appreciate an app that could generate recipes by using photos of ingredients currently in the pantry.

#### Stakeholder 5: Caitlyn

- Worries about the time taken to input ingredients into the app possibly being longer than the amount of time saved by the recipe generating feature.

## Product Vision Statement

SnapCook aims to transform the culinary experience for young professionals by generating personalized recipes based on the ingredients available in their fridge, encouraging resourcefulness, saving time, and reducing food waste-- paving the way for a sustainable and efficient kitchen.

## User Requirements

-   As a user, I want the app to automatically know the expiration date of products without labeled dates so that I don't have to remember or guess.

-   As a user, I want the app to require minimal manual input so that I can save time and effort.
-   As a user, I want the app to remind me how long fruits and vegetables have been in my fridge so that I can make better judgments about their freshness.
-   As a user, I want assurance that the app will not misjudge the edibility of food items so that I don't risk getting sick.
-   As a user, I want the app to suggest recipes based on what I have left in the fridge so that I can use up everything before a trip.
-   As a user, I want the app to partner with delivery services like Amazon Fresh so that I can easily purchase any additional ingredients I might need.
-   As a user, I want the app to provide a variety of recipes so that I can try new dishes and not get bored of eating the same thing.
